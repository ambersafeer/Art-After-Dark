		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>Art After Dark is both a series of competitive arts competitions combined with a 2-night festival held in New Brunswick, NJ. Participants of the art competitions will have their work displayed on College Avenue beginning at sundown on September 1, 2024.</p>
		<h3>Why at Night?</h3>
		<p>Hosting an arts festival at night may seem ludicrous. However, Art After Dark prides itself on its unconventionality. We provide enough lighting throughout the park so that each artwork is properly lit, while still embracing the beautiful blanket of the night sky. Besides aesthetics, we have many reasons for hosting our festival at night:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Holding the festival at night helps guests keep away from the summer heat.</li>
			<li>People tend to be more available in the evenings, and we would love to see more faces there!</li>
			<li>The darkness of the night allows us to display the films on a large outdoor projector screen.</li>
			<li>Parties are just better at night!</li>
		
		
		
		</ol>
