		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>Art After Dark is both a series of competitive arts competitions combined with a 2-night festival held in New Brunswick, NJ. Participants of the art competitions will have their work displayed on College Avenue beginning at sundown on September 1, 2024.</p>
		<h3>Why at Night?</h3>
		<p>Hosting an arts festival at night may seem ludicrous. However, Art After Dark prides itself on its unconventionality. We provide enough lighting throughout the park so that each artwork is properly lit, while still embracing the beautiful blanket of the night sky. Besides aesthetics, we have many reasons for hosting our festival at night:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Holding the festival at night helps guests keep away from the summer heat.</li>
			<li>People tend to be more available in the evenings, and we would love to see more faces there!</li>
			<li>The darkness of the night allows us to display the films on a large outdoor projector screen.</li>
			<li>Parties are just better at night!</li>
		</ol>

		<h3>Entry</h3>
		<p>In order to make sure that we have sufficient supplies and food for everyone, we ask that attendees sign in and wear the given wrist band to help us identify who is part of the event and who is just passing by. Signing in will also have you entered into a raffle to win some big prizes each night!</p>
		<h3>Workshops</h3>
		<p>Workshops hosted by our talented staff, guest artists, and even judges will be taking place throughout the festival. Additionally, you can choose to be a part of a happening, or a piece of performance art, right here at the event!</p>
		<h3>Live Music</h3>
		<p>To help kick us off, we will be having New Brunswick-based bands and singers performing in Vorhees Mall. If you or anyone you know has hearing sensitivities, earplugs are available upon request (but we recommend that you bring your own headphones, if necessary). Additionally, once the films start rolling, the music will go on an intermission.</p>
		
		<h3>Announcements</h3>
		<p>The center of Vorhees Mall will be where all of the festival's important announcements will be taking place, including workshop times, raffle winners, and competition results!</p>
		<p>Food and drinks will be provided throughout the night, although there are many restaurants around as well (at the Yard, George Street, Easton Avenue, etc.) if you wish to find something else! Bathrooms are also available in every building surrounding the event.</p>
