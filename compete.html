		<h2>About the Application</h2>
		<p>Art After Dark hosts competitions within four artistic disciplines: Digital Art, Film, Illustration, and Mixed Media. As the festival expands and we gain more support, we hope to incorporate more categories and prizes for winners. Currently, we partner with the Zimmerli Art Museum to help bring student art to the public eye after the festival concludes.</p>
		<p>Each artist may submit up to 3 artworks per category, but note that each artist may only be chosen as a winner once to help bring support to other artists. The application requests that you provide your name, contact information, high quality photos of your artwork, its name, and a description relating to your artistic process and inspiration for the piece.</p>
